**My conclusions and understandings about it:**

**Solving the simulation-to-real problem needs a combination of methods.**

i.Better simulators.Build a suitable training environment for RL

&ensp;accurate robot parameters.
 
&ensp;trains use Domain Randomization for robustness

ii.Better Models 


&ensp;Models of Motor Primitives

&enspModels of State Transition

iii.Hierarchical Controllers and Distributed Controllers

iV.examples

**V.Conclusions, Outlook, and Limitations**

&ensp;Deploying Relay (RL) on complex robots is challenging; 
&ensp;the stability of RL needs improvement
&ensp;Better simulators are required to adapt RL for deployment on real robots.
